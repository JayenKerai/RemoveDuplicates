# RemoveDuplicates

Problem 4: Remove duplicates from an array

Write a program to remove duplicates from an array in Java without using the Java Collection API. The array can be an array of String, Integer or Character, your solution should be independent of the type of array.
Please write the unit tests for your solution using any of the unit testing framework.

## Dependencies used
* JUnit 5.5.2 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api

## Assumptions
1. Removes the first value if a duplicate is found

## To Run
1. Run Main.main()

## Highlights
1. Program works with mixed datatypes within arrays

## Improvements
1. Could keep null values in an array
   * currently the program crashes if a null value is found
2. Could provide handling for invalid inputs
